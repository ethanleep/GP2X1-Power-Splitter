# GP2X1-Power-Splitter

These are the board files for an RF power splitter based on the Mini-Circuits GP2X1+ power splitter IC. It can handle up to 1.5W between a frequency range of 2900 - 6200 MHz. It has tested and verified to work but I cannot guarentee performance characteristics because I simply dont have the tools to test it. The boards are 4 layer FR408 PCBs ordered from OSH Park due to the decent RF performance and cost. The boards are uploaded to the OSH Park website and can be viewed and ordered below.
